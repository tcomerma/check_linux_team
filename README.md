# check_linux_team

Nagios Plugin for checking status of network team devices or bond devices on linux.

It checks for both teams (Centos 7) o bonds (Centos 6 & 7). The idea is to make easy to monitor
our platform where we have a mixture.
Not tested on other linux distributions where it can need some tunning.
